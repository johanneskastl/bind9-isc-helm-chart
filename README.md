# Helm Chart for bind9

## This chart is deprecated!

**Attention**

This chart is **deprecated** in favor of the chart in the
[johanneskastl-helm-charts](https://johanneskastl.github.io/helm-charts/)
repository!

This helm chart is based on the [official ISC docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/internetsystemsconsortium/bind9).

## Setting up bind9 as a resolver

By default, this chart will setup Bind9 as a resolver.

In case you want to forward a zone to your internal nameservers, you can create a secret containing valid named configuration that might look something like this:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-named-configuration-secret
stringData:
  named.conf.local: |
    zone "my.corporate-domain.example.org" {
        type static-stub;
        server-addresses {
                192.168.1.1;
                192.168.1.2;
        };
    };
```

Please pay attention that this can ONLY contain zone settings or similar, no `options` blocks are allowed (as they are already set in the configuration generated by the chart).

You need to provide the name of this secret in the `values.yaml` file like so:

```
[...]
mount_configuration_from_secret:
  secretName: my-named-configuration-secret
[...]
```

After that, install the helm chart like described in the chart's [README](charts/bind9/README.md).

## Setting up bind as an authoritative nameserver

You can use this chart to set up an authoritative nameserver by setting the `chartMode` value to `authoritative`. This will generate a basic named.conf with recursion disabled. However, you need to create a secret containing the actual nameserver configuration (i.e. zones) and let the chart mount this secret into the pod.

First, create a secret like this:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-named-nameserver-configuration-secret
stringData:
  named.conf.local: |
    zone "example.org" in {
         type master;
         file "/named_config/example.org.zone";
         notify no;
    };
  example.org.zone: |
    $TTL 2h                             ; default TTL
    @ IN SOA dns.example.org.     dnsmaster.example.org. (
                        2022032900      ; serial
                        24h             ; refresh
                        2h              ; retry
                        1000h           ; expire
                        2d )            ; minimum
[...]
```

Please pay attention that this can ONLY contain zone settings or similar, no `options` blocks are allowed (as they are already set in the configuration generated by the chart).

Notice that there are two keys in that secret, one for the `named.conf.local` and one for the zone file (`example.org.zone` in the example). Both of these keys are being mounted as files to `/named_config/`.
The zone file is referenced in the named configuration contained in the `named.conf.local` part. The `named.conf.local` is being loaded by bind automatically due to the configuration that the helm chart sets up.

To use your secret you need to provide the name of this secret in the `values.yaml` file like so:

```
[...]
mount_configuration_from_secret:
  secretName: my-named-nameserver-configuration-secret
[...]
```
